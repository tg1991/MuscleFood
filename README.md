Tests for Muscle Food task

Did enough test coverage for upto task Return coins.

Did plenty of check ins to highlight the stage I took for writing my tests first and then my approach of writing enough code to pass each one and going back 
to make corerctions if needed to make the next ones pass. 

total task took me about 3-4 hours, was doing it between work and other tasks so nicely spready it through the day. 

functional javascript is located in MuscleFood\MuscleFoodTask\Scripts\VendingMachine.js
test scripts are located at MuscleFood\MuscleFoodTask\Specs\VendingMachneTests.js
